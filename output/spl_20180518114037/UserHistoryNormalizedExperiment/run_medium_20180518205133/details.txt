Experiment took 86.7796 minutes.
About UserHistoryNormalizedExperiment: Adds as new features |prop_starrating - visitor_hist_starrating|, same for price_usd. Intuition: higher values for these features means the booking deviates from the visitor's usual taste. Is 0 when there is no visitor history (reflecting the idea that in that case, all hotels in the srch_id should be fine). In addition, also normalizes features: these new ones, as well as the ones that SrchIdNormalizedExperiment also normalizes.
