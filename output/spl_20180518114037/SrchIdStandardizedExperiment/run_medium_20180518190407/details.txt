About SrchIdStandardizedExperiment: Here, some of the attributes also get a version that is standardized within the group of rows of the same srch_id, meaning that for all hotels within that group, for a given attribute, it gets an additional feature that is divided by the standard variation after the mean is subtracted. The standardized attributes are: ['prop_starrating', 'prop_review_score', 'prop_location_score1', 'prop_location_score2', 'price_usd', 'orig_destination_distance']
