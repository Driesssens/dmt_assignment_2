Details of run run_development_20180517145148 of SrchIdNormalizedExperiment on the development set.
About SrchIdNormalizedExperiment: Here, some of the attributes also get a version that is normalized within the srch_id, meaning that for all hotels with that srch_id, for a given attribute, the hotel with the highest value for that attribute gets an additional feature with value 1, the lowest a new feature with value 0, and the others in between. The attributes are: ['price_usd', 'prop_starrating']
